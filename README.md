This is a simple implementation to show the power of Retreival Augmented Generation with the awesome power of Streamlit for a beautiful UI presentation. You will need to obtain a Gemini pass key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey, add it to the .env file then launch the app with "Streamlit run app.py". 

Enjoy!
